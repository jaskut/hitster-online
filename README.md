# Hitster Online

Online version of Hitster - a music timeline guessing game using **QR code scanning** from physical cards.

## Game Concept

**Hitster Online** combines physical cards with digital gameplay:

- 🃏 **Physical Cards**: Each card has a QR code containing song information
- 📱 **Digital Interface**: Smartphone/tablet scans QR codes and plays music
- 🎵 **Interactive Gameplay**: Listen, guess the year, check the physical card for answers
- 👥 **Social Gaming**: Perfect for parties and group play

## How to Play

1. **📱 Scan QR Code**: Point your phone camera at a Hitster card's QR code
2. **🎵 Listen to Song**: Music starts playing automatically from Spotify
3. **🤔 Make Your Guess**: Discuss and guess what year the song was released
4. **🃏 Check Answer**: Flip the physical card to see the correct year
5. **🔄 Repeat**: Scan the next card to continue the game!
